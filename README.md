Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?
  The basic understanding of the app was to utilize CRUD elements to formulate and alter a list.
  
What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?
  There were three screens that I utilized. Two of which were accessible to the average user. The third is for administrators to set privilages. This was implemented to help restrict malintent from users. The two primary screens utilized a basic view to ensure no misunderstandings with the average user.
  
How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?
  I approached through a two step process. The first step was to design how I wanted the app to look and function. The next step was to code all the different aspects of the app. This tied both the design and code aspects together to give the user a positive experince.
  
How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?
  I tested the app by first solving all the errors in my code. If I had only one error, then testing would be worthless. After I did this, my next task was to run the program. This took several attempts to get funtionality perfect. This process is known as whitebox testing and blackbox testing. First in whitebox testing, you want to ensure that your code can work properly. In blackbox testing, you want to ensure that the device works properly. By utilizing these testing practices, I ensured that testing was as thorough as possible.
  
Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?
  During the planning phase, there were mutiple aspects that I wanted to introduce. The problem that I faced was screen space utilization. If I put to much on the screen, it would confuse the user. I had to find a way to condense down the requirenments to just the basics. I broke it down to only implement CRUD (create, read, update, and delete). With this mindset, I could narrow down requirnments to give basic functionality.
  
In what specific component from your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?
  The part of the app that I am most proud of was the layout of the design. I spent many days on going through scenerios, that the user might encounter, and found a way to counter them. I took the users concerns very seriously when I designed the layout. Anyone can code a list anymore, but thinking in terms of the users experience is what most businesses look for in new employees. To put the user first, and your own success second.
